AI Recruiter: Hi there! I'm happy to kick off the interview for the Frontend React Developer position at WebSolutions Inc. To start, could you please tell me a bit about yourself and your background?

Candidate: "Uh, hi. I'm Jane. I'm looking for a frontend developer role. I've done some college courses in web design."

AI Recruiter: Hello Jane, thank you for that introduction. I see from your resume that you have experience with WordPress and basic HTML/CSS, and that you've worked on a personal blog. Could you tell me more about the technical challenges you faced while building your personal blog and how you overcame them?

Candidate: "Oh, technical challenges? Hmm. I guess there were some things. I'm not really sure I can think of specific ones right now. It was a while ago."

AI Recruiter: Let's move on to some technical questions.

Can you explain the concept of component lifecycle in React?

Candidate: "React lifecycle? Hmm. I'm not really sure about that. I know WordPress has some things like that, but React... I don't know."

AI Recruiter: Let's try a different question.

In React, what is the difference between state and props?

Candidate: "Uh, state and props?  I'm not really sure about that.  They're both... things in React, right?"

AI Recruiter: Let's try another question.

Can you explain what the `useState` hook is used for in React?

Candidate: "Uh, `useState`? I think it's for... keeping track of things? Like, when something changes on the page."

AI Recruiter: Before we wrap up, do you have any questions for me?

Candidate: No, thank you. I think you've covered everything I wanted to know.

AI Recruiter: Thank you, that's it for today.
